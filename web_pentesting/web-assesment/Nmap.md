example scan 
```
sudo nmap -p80  -sV 192.168.50.20
```
-sV is for service detection 
-p is for port number

if we find that port 80 is open or any port with some sort of common web port, we can follow up with :

```
sudo nmap -p80 --script=http-enum 192.168.50.20
```

this will do initial finger printing and find some useful data like dirs on website and possible vulnerabilities.
