Once we have discovered an application running on a web server, our next step is to map all its publicly accessible files and directories.

Due to its brute forcing nature, Gobuster can generate quite a lot of traffic, meaning it will not be helpful when staying under the radar is necessary.

 **-u** is the target ip
 **-w** is the wordlist you would like to use
 -t is the threads, default is 10(more threads the more noise/traffic)
 example:
```
gobuster dir -u 192.168.50.20 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -t 5
```
