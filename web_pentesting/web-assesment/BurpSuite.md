#### web proxy
a web proxy is any dedicated hardware or software meant to intercept requests and/or responses between the web client and the web server.

in proxy tab:
When _Intercept_ is enabled, we have to manually click on _Forward_ to send each request to its destination.
By default, Burp Suite enables a proxy listener on **localhost:8080**

To set up webproxy with firefox and burp:
- In Firefox, we can do this by navigating to **about:preferences#general**, scrolling down to _Network Settings_, then clicking _Settings_.
- choose the _Manual_ option
- the proxy (Burp) and the browser reside on the same host, so we'll use the loopback IP address 127.0.0.1 and specify port 8080
- we also want to enable this proxy server for all protocol options to ensure that we can intercept every request while testing the target application.
- browse to **http://www.megacorpone.com** (or your target domain) We should find the intercepted traffic in Burp Suite under _Proxy_ > _HTTP History_.

**Note**
In some testing scenarios, we might want to capture the traffic from multiple machines, so the proxy will be configured on a standalone IP. In such cases, we will configure the browser with the external IP address of the proxy.

##### Repeater
- Repeater, we can craft new requests or easily modify the ones in History, resend them, and review the responses
- we can right-click a request from _Proxy_ > _HTTP History_ and select _Send to Repeater
- We can send multiple requests to Repeater, and it will display them using separate tabs.

##### Intruder
- we'll need to configure our local Kali's /etc/hosts file to statically assign the IP
**Note** - Some web applications will include their hostname in links and redirects. If we don't have an entry in /etc/hosts that matches the web application's hostname, our browser and other tools may not be able to follow these links.
example of brute forcing 
-  dealing with a new target - configure the Proxy as we did before ^
- Returning to Burp, we'll navigate to _Proxy_ > _HTTP History_, right-click on the POST request to **/wp-login.php** (or login page we are using) and select _Send to Intruder_.
-  _Intruder_ tab in the upper bar, choose the POST request we want to modify
- move to the _Positions_ sub-tab.
- press _Clear_ on the right bar so that all fields are cleared
- select the value of the _pwd_ key and press the _Add_ button on the right
- now instructed the Intruder to modify only the password value on each new request.
- we can paste a wordlist into the _Payload Options: [Simple list]_ area
- click on the top right _Start Attack_
