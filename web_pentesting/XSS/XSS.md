[_Cross-Site Scripting_](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/)Â (XSS)is a vulnerability that exploits a user's trust in a website by dynamically injecting content into the page rendered by the user's browser.

One of the most important features of a well-defended web application isÂ [_data sanitization_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_validation), a process in which user input is processed so that all dangerous characters or strings are removed or transformed. Unsanitized data allows an attacker to inject, and potentially execute, malicious code.

- Stored XSS attacks_, also known asÂ _Persistent XSS_, occur when the exploit payload is stored in a database or otherwise cached by a server.
	- often exist in forum software, especially in comment sections, in product reviews, or wherever user content can be stored and reviewed later.
- _Reflected XSS attacks_Â usually include the payload in a crafted request or link. The web application takes this value and places it into the page content. This XSS variant only attacks the person submitting the request or visiting the link.
	- can often occur in search fields and results
- DOM-based XSS attacks occur when a browser parses the page's content and inserted JavaScript is executed
