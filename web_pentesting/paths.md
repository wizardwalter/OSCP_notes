pwd - curent spot in file system
cat - display contents of a file(if doesnt work means it is a dir)
cd - change directory
cd ../ - back a dir
cd ../../../../../../../etc/paswd - the amount of ../ will only go to root, you add more than enough this way you ensure you got to the root dir before going into etc or any other dir you'd like.
