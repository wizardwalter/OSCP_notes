SQL injection can lead to authentication bypass...

```
<?php
$uname = $_POST['uname'];
$passwd =$_POST['password'];

$sql_query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE user_name= '$uname' AND password='$passwd'";
$result = mysqli_query($con, $sql_query);
?>
```

The above shows a web vulnerability where we are providing input $uname and $passwd(from a form most likely), we can use SQL injection for example by exploiting the $uname parameter.
```
offsec' OR 1=1 -- //
```

we can prematurely terminate the SQL statement. The syntax for this type of comment requires two consecutive dashes followed by at least one whitespace character. The // is to make sure nothing after runs to interfere with our injection, look at the following:
```
SELECT * FROM users WHERE user_name= 'offsec' OR 1=1 --
```

Because we have OR 1=1 this will always be true, hence it will theoretically force SQL to return the first user from users even if 'offsec' user doesnt exist because no other checks are implemented in the application.

another example to check OS and version of MySql:
```
' or 1=1 in (select @@version) -- //
```
We're using the _IN_ operator to compare a boolean value (`1=1`) with what should be a numeric value (the database version). If this causes an error, the application might indicate which values caused the error and thus allow us to get the database version number.
