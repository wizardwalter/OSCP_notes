SQL injection can lead to authentication bypass...

```
<?php
$uname = $_POST['uname'];
$passwd =$_POST['password'];

$sql_query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE user_name= '$uname' AND password='$passwd'";
$result = mysqli_query($con, $sql_query);
?>
```

The above shows a web vulnerability where we are providing input $uname and $passwd(from a form most likely), we can use SQL injection for example by exploiting the $uname parameter.
```
offsec' OR 1=1 -- //
```

we can prematurely terminate the SQL statement. The syntax for this type of comment requires two consecutive dashes followed by at least one whitespace character.
