_White-box_ testing describes scenarios in which we have unconstrained access to the application's source code, the infrastructure it resides on, and its design documentation.

_black-box_ testing (also known as a _zero-knowledge_ test) provides no information about the target application, meaning it's essential for the tester to invest significant resources into the enumeration stage.

Grey-box testing occurs whenever we are provided with limited information on the target's scope, including authentication methods, credentials, or details about the framework.

##### enumeration

Many web application vulnerabilities are technology-agnostic. In other words, a technology-agnostic approach focuses on **concepts, methodologies, and best practices** rather than being tied to a particular tool, software, or framework.

some exploits and payloads need to be crafted based on the technological underpinnings of the application, such as the database software or operating system.

Before launching any attacks on a web application, we should first attempt to discover the technology stack in use. Technology stacks generally consist of a host operating system, web server software, database software, and a frontend/backend programming language.

In the debugger tool:

- Some extensions, like **.php**, are straightforward, but others are more cryptic and vary based on the frameworks in use. For example, a Java-based web application might use **.jsp**, **.do**, or **.html**.
-  Applications leveraging routes use logic to determine what content is returned to the user, making URI extensions largely irrelevant.
- Response headers are a subset of [_HTTP headers_](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers) that are sent in response to an HTTP request.
	- The _Server_ header displayed above will often reveal at least the name of the web server software. In many default configurations, it also reveals the version number.
	- HTTP headers are not always generated solely by the web server. For instance, web proxies actively insert the [_X-Forwarded-For_](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Forwarded-For) header to signal the web server about the original client IP address.
	- Some examples of non-standard headers include _X-Powered-By_, _x-amz-cf-id_, and _X-Aspnet-Version_. Further research into these names could reveal additional information, such as that the "x-amz-cf-id" header indicates the application uses [Amazon CloudFront](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/RequestAndResponseBehaviorCustomOrigin.html#request-custom-headers-behavior).
- Inclusive directives are performed with the [_sitemaps_](https://www.sitemaps.org/) protocol, while **robots.txt** excludes URLs from being crawled.
	- sitemap files should not be overlooked because they may contain clues about the website layout or other interesting information, such as yet-unexplored portions of the target.


##### Gobuster

The API name is often quite descriptive about the feature or data it uses to operate, followed directly by the version number.

We can call this feature by using the **-p** option and providing a file with patterns.
example:
```
{GOBUSTER}/v1
{GOBUSTER}/v2
```
we are using the "{GOBUSTER}" placeholder to match any word from our wordlist



NOTE -
- robots.txt and sitemap.xml could be important directories
- **/etc/hosts** - can add domain to this for known ip to possible find more dirs that arent reachable via only ip
