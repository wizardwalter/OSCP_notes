_White-box_ testing describes scenarios in which we have unconstrained access to the application's source code, the infrastructure it resides on, and its design documentation.

_black-box_ testing (also known as a _zero-knowledge_ test) provides no information about the target application, meaning it's essential for the tester to invest significant resources into the enumeration stage.

Grey-box testing occurs whenever we are provided with limited information on the target's scope, including authentication methods, credentials, or details about the framework.

##### enumeration

Many web application vulnerabilities are technology-agnostic. In other words, a technology-agnostic approach focuses on **concepts, methodologies, and best practices** rather than being tied to a particular tool, software, or framework.

some exploits and payloads need to be crafted based on the technological underpinnings of the application, such as the database software or operating system.

Before launching any attacks on a web application, we should first attempt to discover the technology stack in use. Technology stacks generally consist of a host operating system, web server software, database software, and a frontend/backend programming language.
