add a script argument to nmap like so :
```
sudo nmap -sV -p 443 --script "vuln" 192.168.50.124
```
this can provide a number of useful data and certain vulnerabilities you can act on

to find all scripts go to :
```
cd /usr/share/nmap/scripts/

cat scripts.db
```


to check for a specific CVE:
search for [cve] nse, example:
```
CVE-2021-41773 nse
```
download the nse file(look for a git repo) script
put it in **/usr/share/nmap/scripts/[whatever you named download file/script]** 

run Â **--script-updatedb**
```
sudo nmap --script-updatedb
```

then use like so:
```
sudo nmap -sV -p 443 --script "http-vuln-cve2021-41773" 192.168.50.124
```

#### Note **
we also need to keep in mind that an NSE script may contain malicious code that gives an attacker full access to our system, so verify source as well as read script before hand, stick with getting scripts from :
