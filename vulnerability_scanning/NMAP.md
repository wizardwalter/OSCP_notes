**After doing a nessus vuln scan, and finding a cve, cross check with nmap by downloading the cve script for nmap and running it against target machine.**

add a script argument to nmap like so :
```
sudo nmap -sV -p 443 --script "vuln" 192.168.50.124
```
this can provide a number of useful data and certain vulnerabilities you can act on, note using "vuln" will use all scripts within the vuln category. 

this will return(if found vuln): POCs marked *exploit* as well as at the bottom will give more details(if found) on CVE(id say go with this one but check out other cves(if found))

to find all scripts go to :
```
cd /usr/share/nmap/scripts/

cat scripts.db
```


to check for a specific CVE:
search for [cve] nse, example:
```
CVE-2021-41773 nse
```
download the nse file(look for a git repo) script
put it in **/usr/share/nmap/scripts/[whatever you named download file/script]** 

make sure when you curl you use  https://raw.githubusercontent.com, example:
```
sudo curl -o /usr/share/nmap/scripts/http-vuln-cve-2021-41773.nse https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RootUp/PersonalStuff/master/http-vuln-cve-2021-41773.nse
```

run  **--script-updatedb**
```
sudo nmap --script-updatedb
```

then use like so:
```
sudo nmap -sV -p 443 --script "http-vuln-cve2021-41773" 192.168.50.124
```

#### Note **
we also need to keep in mind that an NSE script may contain malicious code that gives an attacker full access to our system, so verify source as well as read script before hand, stick with getting scripts from :
