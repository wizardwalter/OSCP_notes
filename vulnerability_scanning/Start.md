Key to successful vuln scanning is:
1. Host discovery
2. Port scanning
3. Operating system, service, and version detection
4. Matching the results to a vulnerability database

The [_Common Vulnerability Scoring System_](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss) (CVSS) is a framework for addressing the characteristics and severity of vulnerabilities.
Ratings from 1 to 10, 1 being low and 10 being the worst.
