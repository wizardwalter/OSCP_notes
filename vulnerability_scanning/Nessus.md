A policy is a set of predefined configuration options in the context of a Nessus scan. When we save a policy, we can use it as a template for a new scan.

For network scan can provide:
IP address, an IP range, and a comma-delimited _Fully-Qualified Domain Name_ (FQDN), or an IP address list

Unauthenticated - usually less noise and traffic
Authenticated - can be a lot of traffic and noise( can create logs on target machine, etc)

For Linux and macOS targets, SSH is used. While we can also use SSH on Windows, in most cases, we will use [_Server Message Block_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Message_Block) (SMB) and [_Windows Management Instrumentation_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Management_Instrumentation) (WMI) to perform authenticated vulnerability scans against Windows targets.
