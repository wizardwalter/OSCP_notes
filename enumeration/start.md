Passive Information Gathering, also known as Open-source Intelligence (OSINT), is the process of collecting openly-available information about a target, generally without any direct interaction with that target, in order to keep our footprint low.

Active is when you are gathering information directly interacting with the target(ex: port scans, DNS enumeration)
